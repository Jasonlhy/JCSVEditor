# JCSVEditor
Modified from past GUI program assignment.

Getting crazy with excel which removes the leading zero by default.
I just want to have a lightweight CSV editor which displays the raw data and have a file explorer.

# Advantage over Excel
1. Supports UTF-8 encoding
2. Do not lock the file, just refresh the file.
3. Raw text of the csv file, no formatting, no leading zero.

# Known issue
- The input file should be a valid csv format.
